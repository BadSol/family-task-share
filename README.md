# family-task-share
Simple django app created using Django Rest Framework using postgresql db.

The main idea behind this projects is creating simple task sharing application where You can not only delegate tasks for other users, but also create open tasks for given group/family in which any member can declare himself to take on that task. Afterall its all about helping each other out in the family.

I have started this project to learn Django from scratch and quickly decided to use DRM alongside (mostly for learning purposes).
Thanks to this app I have got better understanding of class based views and expirience in writing better, more optymalised test cases (I have stopped rendering views).
